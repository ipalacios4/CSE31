Activity 1;
1. It should just print out the number two in Hex form which is just
   2.
2. The expected out come should be the letter A
4. It printed out the letter A and depending on the print command one
    either gets 'A' or 41.I am not surpised by the results.
5a. 2 arrays were allocated in the program
5b. At one point four_ints and four_c are pointing in the same location
6. The difference in the two first consecutive values is the type casting
    since inicially the array was an integer array and when you type cast It
    to characters it puts all the A's into one index because a character is 
    only one byte.
7. 
8. Here the two consecutive numbers are the same. This is because the array is
    now a character array and each index only has enough space for one character
